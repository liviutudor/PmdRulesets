# PmdRulesets
Sets of PMD rulesets to be used across all my projects

This contains just an XML file containing all the rules I've decided to be wise to use across all my projects with the [PMD plugin](https://pmd.github.io/).

The minimum version of PMD this is meant to be running with is **5.5.2** -- and I will update this here as it changes.
